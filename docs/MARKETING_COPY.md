Subtitle: How a simple Chrome extension can transform your search experience

---

Have you ever noticed that searching in English often gives you better results than searching in your native language? Especially when looking for technical documentation, academic papers, or international resources?

I certainly have. As a developer, I spend a significant portion of my day searching for solutions, documentation, and tutorials. And I've learned that English search queries consistently return more comprehensive and up-to-date results.

But there's a problem: manually translating my search queries is tedious and breaks my flow. Copy-pasting into Google Translate, switching tabs, copying the translation back - it adds up to a lot of wasted time and mental overhead.

So I built Search Translate to solve this problem.

- Intelligent positioning (never goes off-screen)

### Privacy First
All translations are cached locally on your device. No data collection, no tracking, no analytics. Your privacy matters.

### Lightning Fast
Smart caching and debouncing ensure instant results without slowing down your browser.

The extension uses smart caching to minimize API calls and provide instant results. It also features intelligent positioning logic to ensure the suggestion window never goes off-screen, regardless of your viewport size.

## Open Source

Search Translate is completely open source. The code is available on GitHub, and contributions are welcome! Whether you want to:
